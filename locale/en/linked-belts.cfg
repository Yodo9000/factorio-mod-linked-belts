force-compatibility=Ignore incompatibilities between some mods

[mod-setting-description]
force-compatibility-description=Warning! Enabling this setting will allow LinkedBelts to work with mods that are slightly incompatible (namely, if they both add undergrounds of the same speed), but if those mod incompatibilities are fixed later, it can cause that tier of linked-belt to disappear!
